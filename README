 Summary
   A simple HTTP server to stream audio from DVB-T stations on Linux systems.
   The primary goal is to provide DVB Radio to squeezecenter from Logitech (see http://www.slimdevices.com)
 
 Changes
   Version 1.0 Graham Chapman - 6th November 2008
     First Release!
   Version 1.1 Graham Chapman - 8th November 2008
     Use direct http and ts2radio instead of mplayer to get stream
        ts2radio is included in the distribution
     Use icy-metadata to get program details to squeezecentre
   Version 2.0 Graham Chapman - 11th November 2008
     Remove dependancy on getstream and ts2radio binaries - just use perl module Linux::DVB instead
     Include DVB-S and DVB-C (untested) support.
     Command line parsing for setting common options (use --help for details)
   Version 2.1 Graham Chapman - 13th November 2008
     Minor updates - clean disconnects and disconnect when client stops taking data 

 Features
   - Uses a standard format (from dvbscan) channels.conf file
   - Automatically retunes when a channel from a different multiplex is requested.
   - Stream multiple stations from one multiplex concurrently
   - Stream audio from TV channels or Radio (audio only) channels
   - Serves an HTML channel list linking to playlists (PLS Format) for easy configuration of squeezecenter
   - Provide current program information from DVB Now & Next EIT data
   - Optionally run stream through a filter (eg. lame to resample 48KHz->44.1KHz for squeeze slave)

 Streams available
   - RAW (normally MP2) with Icy-metadata stream info (if requested by the client)

 Requirements
   - Linux installation with working DVB Card
   - dvbscan style channels.conf (default location file at /etc/dvbserver.conf)
   - Perl 
   - Perl Modules:
      Linux::DVB
        Unfortunately the version on CPAN is broken for DVB-T tuning, see note below
      IO::Socket, IO::Select, IO::Handle, IPC::Open2, Fcntl, POSIX
        Should be on any Linux Perl distro - if squeezecentre works, you have them!

Linux::DVB
   A perl interface to the Linux DVB API.
   The version on CPAN is broken for DVB-T tuning. Fixed source, and a Linux i386 binary are included.
   If you are running a modern i386 Linux, you should be able to just:
    - Open a linux command prompt or terminal window
    - cd to the Linux-DVB-1.0 directory in same folder as the file
    - Type: make install
            Note: this step required root permissions, you may need eg: sudo make install
   If not, you will need to build it:
    - Ensure you have either Linux kernel headers, or full source installed
    - Ensure you have the base development packages installed (GCC, GLIBC etc)
    - Open a linux command prompt or terminal window
    - cd to the Linux-DVB-1.0 directory in same folder as the file
    - Type: perl -f Makefile.PL
    - Type: make
    - Type: make install
            Note: this step required root permissions, you may need eg: sudo make install

 Quick start
 
 1) Follow the Linux::DVB inructions above
 2) Use dvbscan to create a channel list at /etc/dvbserver.conf (unless you changed the name below)
      eg: dvbscan /usr/share/dvb/dvb-t/uk-Hannington > /etc/dvbserver.conf
      see http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Scan for full instructions
 4) Launch dvbserver.pl
 5) Point a web browser at http://yourhostnamehere:9001/
 6) Either:
     Copy a single channel link and paste it into Squeezecenter, Internet Radio, Tune In URL
    Or:
     Download a channel playlist and save in your Squeezecenter playlists folder (remember to rescan playlists).
 7) If you like it, add dvbserver.pl to your system startup init scripts. (You will want an & after it to make it run in the background.

 In case of problems, use the -d switch to enable verbose output.
 For full command line options run: dvbserver.pl --help

 Known Limitations
  - Only supports 1 DVB adapter
